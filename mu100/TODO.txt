1 or Different files containing the mu100 for DEC and RA different angles (in the sat frame) with sufficient statistics.
Python file to make all the analysis and the storage here (but without storing the raw data on the git)?
---> Need to have different analysis mode/class for both this analysis with not polarized source and for an analysis using the obtained mu100 without doing the unpolarized source ?
